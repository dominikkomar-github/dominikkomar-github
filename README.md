<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Dominik</h1>
<h3 align="center">Data Analyst & Aspiring Junior Developer</h3>

I'm a data enthusiast fueled by Python, passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights.  I recently tackled an exciting project using Plotly to create an interactive dashboard visualizing London Airbnb listings (check it out in Projects!).  I'm a lifelong learner, always eager to dive into new challenges and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

## Skills & Expertise

My expertise lies in leveraging Python to unlock the power of data:

* **Data Analysis:**  Proficient in Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
* **Machine Learning:**  Familiar with K-Means clustering and Logistic Regression (actively seeking to expand my knowledge in this area!).
* **Databases & SQL:**  Comfortable querying data using SQL.
* **Data Visualization:**  Adept at creating clear and informative visualizations to bring data to life.

## Projects

I take pride in tackling real-world data challenges. Here are some highlights:

1. **Interactive Airbnb Analysis (Plotly):**  This project showcases my data wrangling, manipulation, and interactive dashboard creation skills. I explored and visualized trends in London Airbnb listings using Plotly.  [Link to Repository (if applicable)]

2. **Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering:**  By leveraging K-Means clustering in Python, I identified distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior. This project honed my data wrangling and unsupervised learning capabilities. [Link to Repository (if applicable)]

3. **Loan Approval Prediction with Logistic Regression:**  Built a logistic regression model to predict loan approval probabilities. This project strengthened my grasp of feature engineering and supervised learning concepts.  [Link to Repository (if applicable)]

## Learning Journey

The learning never stops!  Currently, I'm expanding my skillset by focusing on:

* R Programming
* Advanced data manipulation techniques with the Pandas library
